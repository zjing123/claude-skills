# Browser Tools

Minimal CDP tools for collaborative site exploration and scraping.

**Credits**: Based on [Mario Zechner](https://mariozechner.at)'s article [What if you don't need MCP?](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-02-what-if-you-dont-need-mcp/), adapted from [Factory.ai](https://docs.factory.ai/guides/skills/browser).

## Setup

Before first use, install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install --prefix skills/browser

#if pnpm can't used, use npm instead of pnpm
```

## Start Chrome

```bash
./skills/browser/scripts/start.js              # Fresh profile
./skills/browser/scripts/start.js --profile    # Copy your profile (cookies, logins)
```

Start Chrome on `:9222` with remote debugging.

## Navigate

```bash
./skills/browser/scripts/nav.js https://example.com
./skills/browser/scripts/nav.js https://example.com --new
```

Navigate current tab or open new tab.

## Evaluate JavaScript

```bash
./skills/browser/scripts/eval.js 'document.title'
./skills/browser/scripts/eval.js 'document.querySelectorAll("a").length'
```

Execute JavaScript in active tab (async context).

**IMPORTANT**: The code must be a single expression or use IIFE for multiple statements:

- Single expression: `'document.title'`
- Multiple statements: `'(() => { const x = 1; return x + 1; })()'`
- Avoid newlines in the code string - keep it on one line

## Screenshot

```bash
./skills/browser/scripts/screenshot.js
```

Screenshot current viewport, returns temp file path.

## Pick Elements

```bash
./skills/browser/scripts/pick.js "Click the submit button"
```

Interactive element picker. Click to select, Cmd/Ctrl+Click for multi-select, Enter to finish.

## Workflow

1. **Start Chrome** with `start.js --profile` to mirror your authenticated state.
2. **Drive navigation** via `nav.js https://target.app` or open secondary tabs with `--new`.
3. **Inspect the DOM** using `eval.js` for quick counts, attribute checks, or extracting JSON payloads.
4. **Capture artifacts** with `screenshot.js` for visual proof or `pick.js` when you need precise selectors or text snapshots.

## Usage Notes

- Start Chrome first before using other tools
- The `--profile` flag syncs your actual Chrome profile so you're logged in everywhere
- JavaScript evaluation runs in an async context in the page
- Pick tool allows you to visually select DOM elements by clicking on them
